<h2 id="sec-history">The History of ViewVC</h2>

<div class="section-body">

<p>The ViewVC software was inspired by early versions of cvsweb
   (originally written by Bill Fenner, further developed by Henner
   Zeller, and now maintained as <a
   href="http://www.freebsd.org/projects/cvsweb.html">CVSweb</a> by
   the FreeBSD community).  Greg Stein wanted to make some changes and
   updates, but cvsweb was implemented in Perl.  He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&quot;While I can manage some Perl, cvsweb was rather
   unmaintainable for me. So I undertook the task to convert the
   software to Python. As a result, I've actually been able to go
   <strong>way</strong> beyond the simple changes that I had
   envisioned.&quot;
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So ViewVC started out as just a port of the cvsweb script,
   originally called ViewCVS.  Along the way, it has had numerous
   cleanups and other modifications, a process simplified by the
   elegance of the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
   language.</p>

<p>In 2001, the ViewCVS project was moved to <a
   href="http://www.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, a popular
   software collaboration environment.  There the project continued to
   mature, releasing several stable-yet-pre-1.0 versions.  In 2002,
   C. Michael Pilato began implementing support for Subversion in
   ViewCVS, taking advantage of a version control abstraction layer
   begun by Lucas Bruand.  Along the way, Russell Yanofsky delivered
   large improvements to that abstraction, and to ViewCVS as whole.
   ViewCVS was well on its way to releasing a 1.0 version.</p>

<p>Of course, now that ViewCVS could browse Subversion repositories as
   easily as CVS ones, the ViewCVS name seemed inappropriate.  Also,
   the active ViewCVS developers at the time were growing frustrated
   with SourceForge as a project hosting environment &mdash;
   Subversion wasn't yet available as an option for version control,
   the CVS service was always down at just the wrong moment, the bug
   trackers were painful to use, and so on.  So in late 2005, the
   decision was made to rename the project to ViewVC, to convert the
   project's CVS data to Subversion, and to move the project and its
   version controlled and open issue data to Tigris.org.</p>

<p>In 2016, development of ViewVC was moved from Tigris.org to
   GitHub.</p>
